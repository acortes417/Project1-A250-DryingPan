# Project-1-A250---Drying-Pan
Project 1 for gernsberger A250 

Currently working on Part B, which includes...
  - Student.h
  - Student.cpp
  - Main.cpp

# Tasks:

### Kyle Fegan:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Student::printStudentInfo
- Student::printStudentInfo (overload)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Status**

*Both functions are complete, I have commited
the h file and took out a pull request for
the cpp. We can accept the pull at any time but
I was thinking we should accept it after the
prerequisite functions are done.*

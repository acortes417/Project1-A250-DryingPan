# Project-1-A250---Drying-Pan
Project 1 for gernsberger A250 

Currently working on Part B, which includes...
  - Student.h
  - Student.cpp
  - Main.cpp

# Tasks:

### Kyle Fegan:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Student::printStudentInfo
- Student::printStudentInfo (overload)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Status:**
*Both functions are complete, I have commited the h file and took out a pull request for the cpp. We can accept the pull at any time but
I was thinking we should accept it after the prerequisite functions are done.*

# Github Terms:

### repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The file where your project and all of its contents are stored.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A branch is basically a copy (or an instance) of the project. The master branch is the final version of the project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A pull request is simply how you submit changes for approval. If you don't want your changes to immediately affect the master branch,
you can start a pull request which will put them in a new branch for the team to look over. This is great to use if you aren't sure
whether or not your changes are correct.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An issue is a conflict in the code which was detected when a merge between branches was attempted. Oftentimes Github will point these
out and come up with a temporary fix until someone looks into the error.
